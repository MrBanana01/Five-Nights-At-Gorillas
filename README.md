# Five-Nights-At-Gorillas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MrBanana01/Five-Nights-At-Gorillas/total.svg)

A gorilla tag mod that recreates the whole five nights at Freddy's game in gorilla tag via a custom GameMode, All credit to the original five nights at Freddy's goes too "Scott Cawthon" or "Scottgames"

To use the mod, you need [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla) and [TMPLoader](https://github.com/AHauntedArmy/TMPLoader), once you load the mod successfully, go to the custom gamemode called "FNAG" and once you join look at the back of stump and you will see the menu.

## WARNING! The light and cameras are NOT synced because it's meant to be a thing you can quickly use with no cooldown. Only doors and enemy pos are synced and the doors have a cooldown of 4 seconds per use

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version is a little bit different from the orignal fnaf 1.

## POWER:
Power is the same as in the game. The more stuff you use the fastwr the power drains
> One thing to note is that when the power goes out, the face does not appear because imo it looked very weird and stupid

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CAMERAS AND ENEMYS:
with gorilla (freddy) being on Cam3 (right hall in the far back) if you keep your camera on there, gorilla (freddy) will only then have a 4 out of 10 chance to attack
same with dingus (foxy) he will only have a 4 out of 10 chance to move if your camera is on Cam8 (pirate cove)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ENEMY NAMES:
the names are kinda suppost to be a joke but here are the enemy names

freddy = gorilla (G)

bonnie = mingus (M)

chica = bob (B)

foxy = dingus (D)

do keep in mind that the jumpscare will be gorilla (freddy) all the time because I am too lazy to add different jumpscares
