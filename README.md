-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MrBanana01/Five-Nights-At-Gorillas/total.svg)

A gorilla tag mod that recreates the whole five nights at Freddy's game in gorilla tag via a custom GameMode, All credit to the original five nights at Freddy's goes too "Scott Cawthon" or "Scottgames"

To use the mod, you need [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla) and [TMPLoader](https://github.com/AHauntedArmy/TMPLoader), once you load the mod successfully, go to the custom gamemode called "FNAG" and once you join look at the back of stump and you will see the menu.

This version is a little bit different from the orignal fnaf 1.

## POWER:
The speed the power drains is not dependent on how much power you are using. Every 15 seconds the mod will check if the right door, left door, right light, or left light is being used, and for each one being used it will remove 2% of power, you if you are using all doors and lights it will remove 8% every 25 seconds, after it checks that it will have a 4 out of 10 chance to remove an extra 3%
> One thing to note is that when the power goes out, the face does not appear because imo it looked very weird and stupid

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CAMERAS AND ENEMYS:
with gorilla (freddy) being on Cam3 (right hall in the far back) if you keep your camera on there, gorilla (freddy) will only then have a 4 out of 10 chance to attack
same with dingus (foxy) he will only have a 4 out of 10 chance to move if your camera is on Cam8 (cove)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ENEMY NAMES:
the names are kinda suppost to be a joke but here are the enemy names

freddy = gorilla (G)

bonnie = mingus (M)

chica = bob (B)

dingus = foxy (D)

do keep in mind that the jumpscare will be gorilla (freddy) all the time because I am too lazy to add different jumpscares
